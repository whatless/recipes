Ingredients

    12 ounces Brussels sprouts (about 24 sprouts), ends removed and halved
    1 pound butternut squash, chopped
    2 large bell peppers, chopped
    1 large onion, sliced into chunks
    4 tablespoons olive oil
    1 teaspoon sage
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    1/2 teaspoon thyme
    1/2 teaspoon rosemary
    1/2 teaspoon chili powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 pinch of black pepper
    1 14-ounce package Premio Hot and Spicy Italian Chicken Sausage (5 sausage links)
    to serve: cooked rice or quinoa (optional)

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

    In a large bowl, add all ingredients except the sausage. Mix together until everything is evenly coated with olive oil and the herbs and spices. Transfer everything to a large baking sheet and lay sausages on top of the veggies. Lightly spray the top of the sausages with cooking spray or brush with olive oil to help the sausages brown.
    Bake on the middle rack for 15 minutes, turn the sausages over, spray the new side with cooking spray and bake another 15 minutes.

    Next, turn the oven broiler on low and cook for 5 more minutes, checking every minute to make sure nothing burns. This will ensure that the veggies and sausages get beautifully crispy and caramelized on the outside.
    Remove from oven and serve with rice or quinoa, if desired.
